# Project 1

### **Project Description:**

USTeam is a mobile application that improves the team formation process by providing information on potential teammates and enabling communication without prior contact. It also promotes transparency in post-project grading by facilitating fair evaluation of the engagement of different group members.

### **Empathize**

### Immerse (Problems)

- Lack of proper channel (know, communicate)
- Not sure if he/she is a free-rider (ability)
- The peer evaluation system is not mature

### Observe (Existing solutions)

- Canvas-people/discussion, Email
    - inefficient, too random
- Circle of friends
    - not every class has friends in it
- Find a deskmate, introduce yourself in class
    - too random needs a lot of courage

**Summary**

Student

- Students want to find reliable teammates but it is difficult.  In the current state, finding groupmates is highly random, such as prof allocated, find in canvas-people/canvas-discussion or people they met in class. Only in rare cases can it be reassuring to have friends taking the same course together.
- For students, work style and open-minded is a very important consideration for teaming. For students in SENG and SSCI, academic ability is also a key factor.
- Students think that work style, ability to express and understand, skills, and basic information are important thing and need to be displayed on the teaming platform.

Instructor

- Instructors usually divided students into 6 per group.
- Instructors through personal log to evaluate individual contributions
- Instructors think that peer evaluation is not efficiency, as they donâ€™t want to create a competing environment for groupmate and want them to collab well.
- For instructors, the key factor for a successful group project is collaboration and how the skills complements.

### **POV**

Student

- Students want to find reliable teammates but it is difficult as lack of channel.  In the current state, either through canvas-people/canvas-discussion or find people they met in class is inefficient.
- In addition, finding groupmates through the above ways is highly random. They do not know the work style, academic ability, personality and so on of each other. Only in rare cases can it be reassuring to have friends taking the same course together.

Instructor

- Instructors has no way to accurately know the contribution of each group member and evaluate individual contributions effectively only through personal log and peer evaluation.

### **Verify**

### **Story Boarding: (by YIN Jianing)**

- For student
    - Me, Strangers (Donâ€™t know others and being isolated) (want to greet but hesitated)
    - Outlook interface (canvas grouping) (Open website, grouping, afraid of being rejected, suffering)
    - App interface, profiling, filtering (Open app, filtering (course: 4461, team capacity: 5, major or ability), arrow to right, some appropriate result with head icons, (Up-right: grouping status, down-right: send request) ï¼‰
    - Matched! A+!
- For instructor
    - Grading interface, difficult to determine
    - Smooth communication
    - Statistics (distribution, contribution, cooperation diagram)
    - Grading interface ðŸ™‚ (students and professors satisfied, free riders regret)

We drafted two storyboards to show the perspectives from both students and professors.

For students, we would like to provide a platform to help them form groups in an easier way:

**Speed Date**

After several rounds of speed dating, we picked the 5th option as its preference rank was more consistent compared to other proposals. Upon the design of a paper prototype, we found that we lacked engaging methods of interactions in this proposal as scanning QR code constantly is - boring. We then considered different gestures that could simplify the experience of the app and maintaining engagement degree
