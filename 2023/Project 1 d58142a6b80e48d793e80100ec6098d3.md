## Outline

### **Project Description:**

USTeam is a mobile application that improves the team formation process by providing information on potential teammates and enabling communication without prior contact. It also promotes transparency in post-project grading by facilitating fair evaluation of the engagement of different group members.

### **Empathize 找出问题 @Jacky**

### Immerse (Problems)

- Lack of proper channel (know, communicate)
- Not sure if he/she is a free-rider (ability)
- The peer evaluation system is not mature

### Observe (Existing solutions)

- Canvas-people/discussion, Email
    - inefficient, too random
- Circle of friends
    - not every class has friends in it
- Find deskmate, introduce yourself in class
    - too random, needs a lot of courage

[Interview](https://www.notion.so/7e5f0c258056413d82b3efd9e9f6f002)

**Persona @Jacky** 

Student

- Groupmates is highly random, such as prof allocated, find in canvas-people/canvas-discussion or people they met in class. Only in rare cases can it be reassuring to have friends taking the same course together.
- Finding a suitable team member is very difficult.
- Work style, whether you can get along well, and open-minded is a very important consideration. For students in SENG and SSCI, academic ability is also a key factor.
- On the team platform, work style, ability to express and understand, skills, and basic information are important and need to be displayed.

Instructor

- Usually 6 students per group
- Through personal log to evaluate individual contributions
- Peer evaluation is not efficiency, as don’t want to create a competing environment for groupmate and want them to collab well.
- The key factor for a successful group project is collaboration and how the skills complements.

### **POV**

After several interviews, we've identified the common issues that HKUST students have with most sustainable campaigns are:

- Lack of time
- Most don't process an ample budget
- lack of feedback on own sustainability

### **Verify**

### **Story Boarding @1+0 @John Tung**

some example: 

![Untitled](Project%201%20d58142a6b80e48d793e80100ec6098d3/Untitled%203.png)

- for student
    - 人，从 (別人成群，孤獨一人，背對)(舉起手打招呼，但欲言又止)
    - outlook界面(canvas grouping)  (打開網頁，顯示grouping，幻想被拒絕，情緒低落，)
    - app界面，profiling，filtering（打開app，顯示篩選條件(course: 4461,組隊人數：5, major or ability ), arrow to right, 幾個合適人選的簡筆畫，(右上角組隊狀態，右下角發出申請) ）
    - matched！A+! （)
- for instructor
    - 打分界面，困惑状
    - smooth communication
    - statistics (distribution, contribution, cooperation diagram)
    - grading interface, 🙂 (學生老師滿意，free rider 失望)

We drafted two storyboards to show the perspectives from both students and professors.

For students, we would like to provide a platform to help them form groups in an easier way:

For professors, we would like to provide a platform to help them grade students in an easier way:

![E1D33C21-B74F-4760-9613-0BA24DD86D08.jpeg](Project%201%20d58142a6b80e48d793e80100ec6098d3/E1D33C21-B74F-4760-9613-0BA24DD86D08.jpeg)

**Speed Date**

After several rounds of speed dating, we picked the 5th option as its preference rank was more consistent compared to other proposals. Upon the design of a paper prototype, we found that we lacked engaging methods of interactions in this proposal as scanning QR code constantly is - boring. We then considered different gestures that could simplify the experience of the app and maintaining engagement degree
